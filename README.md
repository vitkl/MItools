# R Package - MItools
## Molecular interaction data tools, retrieving data using PSICQUIC service

Package contains high-level functions for retrieving molecular interaction data using PSICQUIC service and manipulating that data. Useful options include: query molecular interaction databases using MIQL, retrieve full interactome of a given species, retrieve PPI for a random set of proteins, download protein sequences (FASTA) for canonical, isoform, post-processed chain id. This package also includes functions specific to my research project at Petsalaki group at EMBL-EBI.  
    Builds upon Bioconductor PSICQUIC package and uses data.table.
