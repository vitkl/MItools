Title: Molecular interaction data tools, retrieving data using PSICQUIC service
Version: 0.1.32
Author: Vitalii Kleshchevnikov
Maintainer: Vitalii Kleshchevnikov <vitalii@ebi.ac.uk>
Description: Package contains high-level functions for retrieving molecular interaction data using PSICQUIC service and manipulating that data. Useful options include: query molecular interaction databases using MIQL, retrieve full interactome of a given species, retrieve PPI for a random set of proteins, download protein sequences (FASTA) for canonical, isoform, post-processed chain id. This package also includes functions specific to my research project at Petsalaki group at EMBL-EBI.
    Builds upon Bioconductor PSICQUIC package and uses data.table.
